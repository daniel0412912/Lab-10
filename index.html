        <p>
          Search Engine Optimization (SEO) is important because it helps improve
          a website's visibility and search ranking. One SEO technique that is
          really effective, is keyword research and optimization. Which works by
          identifying keywords that are related to your website such as business
          keywords and displaying them in your website content. This makes it so
          search engines can understand your page easier through search queries
          (Hubspot).
        </p>
        <p>
          Another SEO technique that is important for websites is backlink
          building. This involves taking links from other authoitative and well
          known websites and displaying them on your own website. The purpose is
          that high-quality backlinks essentially tell search engines that your
          site is trustworthy, which in turn improves its ranking (Mailchimp).
        </p>
        <p>
          The third SEO technique is optimizing mobile responsiveness. Since the
          number of mobile users have grown, adding mobile responsiveness can
          increase SEO as a result increase website traffic. This is because
          search engines like Google prioritize mobile-friendly websites in
          their rankings, making them list higher in the search results
          (SEMrush).
        </p>
        <h1 class="subtitle">SMO Techniques</h1>
        <p>
          Social Media Optimization (SMO) is also very important for boosting a
          website's online presence. One useful SMO technique is integrating
          social media sharing buttons on your webpage, such as a Facebook like
          buttom or instagram follow button. The addition of these buttons
          encourages users to interact with your content and increases the
          chances of them sharing it, expanding the reach of your website
          (Designer Websites).
        </p>
        <p>
          Another SMO tactic that is important is creating shareable content.
          Content that will catch a users eye through images or videos is really
          effective. Since they can easily be shared across various social media
          platforms with a click of a button. The use of engaging content
          increases your brand visibility and user interaction as more people
          will be exposed to the content (American Library Association).
        </p>
        <p>
          Lastly, adding relevant keywords to your social media profiles or
          within the content itself, such as contact details or unique
          watermarks can improve your social media presence and make it easier
          for users to find your content and engage with you (WebFX).
